EAD finding aids tagged with named entity URIs for work in the Networking Belfast project.


-----

This fork of repository was created for EAD XML enhancement work being done 
as part of the `Digital Scholarship Commons`_ project `Networking the Belfast Group`_ on resources from 
`Manuscripts, Archives, and Rare Book Library`_ (MARBL).

.. _Digital Scholarship Commons: http://disc.library.emory.edu/
.. _Networking the Belfast Group: http://web.library.emory.edu/disc/projects/networking-belfast-group
.. _Manuscripts, Archives, and Rare Book Library: http://marbl.library.emory.edu

The master branch contains the original MARBL EAD files.

Project contributors should create a branch for the XML file they are working on, tag names and link to 
appropriate authority record URIs (VIAF, GeoNames.org, DBpedia), and commit to the appropriate branch. 


When 
the names are tagged, issue a pull request from the branch for that XML file to the original Beck Center belfast
repository for review and eventual inclusion.  Any feedback or changes required after review from Beck Center staff 
should be made on that branch.
