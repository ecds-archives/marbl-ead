            <p> The notebooks in this series date from the early 1970s to 2007 and include drafts of poems and prose as well as research materials for Carson's published collections during these years.  The earliest notebook includes drafts of a variety of poems, some uncollected, from the early 1970's.  Early notebooks often contain a diverse array of writings; later ones are dedicated to specific poetry or prose projects. Because there are often several notebooks related to a specific volume, these have been numbered and arranged chronologically in the finding aid.</p>

Typescripts and proofs of entire volumes are included at the end of each volume's subsection to roughly demonstrate the chronological development of a published volume.

          <p>While these Arts Council materials are arranged in four subsections, the folders themselves retain Carson's own system of organization. Thus, in most cases the names of particular folders were originally Carson's. "General Materials" contains documents largely pertaining to financial and other such administrative records. "Projects" contains mostly correspondence between the Arts Council and various groups and individuals involved in the organization of specific cultural events and programs. "Correspondence" collects more general <?oxy_delete author="namedropper" timestamp="20130614T170438-0400" content="bodies"?><?oxy_insert_start author="namedropper" timestamp="20130614T170438-0400" comment="Preston 'Bodie' Broadus is a fictional character on the HBO drama The Wire, played by actor J.

His relationship with the police is also dynamic."?><persname source="dbpedia" authfilenumber="Bodie_Broadus">bodies</persname><?oxy_insert_end ?> of communication between the Arts Council and those it supports, whether individuals or institutions.
