Like his contemporaries, Waldron's roots lie chiefly in the hard bop and post-bop genres of the New York club scene of the 1950s; but with time, he gravitated more towards free jazz and composition. He is known for his dissonant chord voicings and distinctive playing style, which was originally inspired by Thelonious Monk."?><persname source="viaf" authfilenumber="49409732">Waldron</persname><?oxy_insert_end ?>, Reg, 1967</unittitle>

His economical and understated style had a strong influence on 20th-century fiction, while his life of adventure and his public image influenced later generations. Hemingway produced most of his work between the mid-1920s and the mid-1950s, and won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954. He published seven novels, six short story collections and two non-fiction works."?><persname source="viaf" authfilenumber="97006051">Ernest</persname><?oxy_insert_end ?> Gebler.

Of Anglo-Irish stock and birth, she was won over to Irish nationalism by the plight of evicted people in the Land Wars. She was also active in Home Rule activities."?><persname source="viaf" authfilenumber="32066208">Maud Gonne</persname><?oxy_insert_end ?> Series</unittitle>
