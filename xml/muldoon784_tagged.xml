            <p>The subseries consists of dramatic works and lyrics composed by Muldoon from the 1970s through the 2000s.  Because the dating of these materials is more tentative, they are arranged in alphabetical order, with the exception of Shining Brow and Bandanna, works that Muldoon collaborated on with Daron Hagen.  The scripts have been divided into radio and television scripts for the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), Muldoon's independent dramatic work, and lyrics Muldoon composed with Rob Mathes for their band, Rackett.</p>
            <p>Because <title>Shining Brow</title> and <title>Bandanna</title> are the most collaborative of Muldoon's works, and because their development spreads over an unusually large number of years, all of the related materials are in a single grouping.  Within this grouping, the materials fall into four areas: (1) manuscript materials, (2) correspondence with Daron Hagen, (3) correspondence with others, and (4) miscellaneous publicity materials and clippings.  The correspondence with Daron Hagen covers their work together on operas <title>Shining Brow</title>, <title>Bandanna</title>, <title>Vera of Las Vegas</title>, and on <title>Muldoon Songs: The Waking Father</title>.  In addition, general correspondence with Daron Hagen appears in this subseries, as the bulk of their correspondence concerns their collaborative works.</p>
