            <p>A central figure in <geogname source="geonames" authfilenumber="7521316">Ulster</geogname>'s literary culture since the late 1960's, Frank Ormsby has led a lively and multifarious writing life as a poet, book and magazine editor, and teacher based in <geogname source="geonames" authfilenumber="2655984" role="schema:homeLocation">Belfast</geogname>. Born in <geogname source="geonames" authfilenumber="2649984" role="dbp:birthPlace">Enniskillen,  County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland</geogname> in <date normal="1947" type="schema:birthDate">1947</date>,
            Ormsby studied English at
            <corpname authfilenumber="173298995" source="viaf" role="schema:alumniOf">Queen's University Belfast</corpname>, where he received an MA. In 1971, he began teaching at the
            <corpname authfilenumber="126719206" source="viaf" role="schema:workLocation">Royal Belfast Academical Institution</corpname>, and he has been Head of English there for
		  many years.</p>
            <p>As a poet, Ormsby established himself in the early seventies with two
		  chapbooks,
		<title>Ripe for Company</title> (1971) and
		<title>Business as Usual</title> (1973). During the 1971-1972 academic
        year, Ormsby also participated in the
        <corpname authfilenumber="123393054" source="viaf" role="schema:memberOf">Belfast Group</corpname> meetings organized by
        <persname authfilenumber="109557338" source="viaf" role="schema:knows">Seamus Heaney</persname> and
        <persname authfilenumber="76349747" source="viaf" role="schema:knows">Michael Allen</persname>. He won the Eric Gregory Award in 1974, and his 1977 volume of poems,
		<title>A Store of Candles</title>, was a Poetry Book Society Choice.
        Ormsby's other collections of poems,
		<title>A Northern Spring</title> (1986) and
		<title>The Ghost Train</title> (1995) have been published with the
        <corpname authfilenumber="147893360" source="viaf" role="schema:association">Gallery Press</corpname>. In 1992, Ormsby won a Cultural Traditions Award given in memory
		of <persname authfilenumber="94401473" source="viaf">John Hewitt</persname>, and in 2002 he was honored with the Lawrence O'Shaughnessy
		Award for Poetry from the <corpname authfilenumber="131195240" source="viaf" role="schema:association">University of St Thomas at St Paul, Minnesota</corpname>.</p>
            <p>Ormsby began his editorial career in 1969, when he and
                <persname authfilenumber="55394043" source="viaf" role="schema:colleague">Michael Foley</persname>
		  succeeded <persname authfilenumber="92591927" source="viaf">James Simmons</persname> as co-editors of
        <title>The Honest Ulsterman</title>. From 1972 to 1984, Ormsby was the
		sole editor of this small but important literary magazine that offered both
		younger and established Northern Irish writers invaluable access to a wider
		public. After editing
		<title>The Honest Ulsterman</title> with
        <persname authfilenumber="33362880" source="viaf" role="schema:colleague">Robert Johnstone</persname>
        from 1984 until 1989, Ormsby left to dedicate himself both to his own poetry and various other
		editorial projects.</p>
            <p>Ormsby's other editorial projects including several very important
		  anthologies produced since the late 1970's.
		<title>Poets From Northern Ireland</title> was first published in 1979
		and then revised in 1990. Similarly,
		<title>The Long Embrace: Twentieth Century Irish Love Poem</title>s was
        published in 1987 and also reprinted in 1990. In 1987, Ormsby produced
		<title>Northern Windows: An Anthology of Ulster Autobiography</title>.
		Another anthology of mostly prose,
		<title>Thine in Storm and Calm: An Amanda McKittrick Ros Reader</title>,
		was released in 1988. Published in 1991,
		<title>The Collected Poems of John Hewitt</title> is a definitive and
        extensively annotated collection of this major Belfast poet's work. Ormsby's
                <title>A Rage for Order: Poetry of the Northern Ireland Troubles</title>
		(1992) is a much heralded and widely used anthology of "Troubles poetry." His
		most recent anthology is
		<title>The Hip Flask: Short Poems from Ireland</title> (2001). In
		addition to these individual volumes, he edited the
		<title>Poetry Ireland Review</title> (Numbers 53-56).</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>The Frank Ormsby papers consist of the poet-editor's personal and
        literary papers from 1968 to 2004. These papers catalog Ormsby's literary
		  career as a poet, an anthologist, and a long-term editor of
		<title>The Honest Ulsterman</title>. The collection focuses on two
        interconnected areas of Ormsby's literary life. On one hand, the papers
        highlight Ormsby's output as a poet, a writer about poetry, and an
		editor-anthologist. On the other hand, this collection is notable for its
		materials relating to
        <title>The Honest Ulsterman</title> and Ormsby's role as editor of this
		magazine, which played an important role in the late twentieth century literary
		culture of <geogname source="geonames" authfilenumber="2641364" role="schema:homeLocation">Northern Ireland</geogname>.</p>
            <p>Ormsby's poetry has been consistently well-received and widely
		  acknowledged since the early 1970's. An extensive series of manuscript and
		  typescript drafts of published and unpublished poems charts the development of
		  the poet across time. Like many other poets in <geogname source="geonames" authfilenumber="2963597" role="schema:homeLocation">Ireland</geogname> and Great Britain,
          Ormsby has also enjoyed a parallel career as a literary journalist. He has
		  written many reviews and essays about other writers and collections of
		  poetry.</p>
            <p>Apart from his writing poetry and critical prose and his magazine
                editing, Ormsby, as anthologist and literary editor, has produced seven
		  anthologies or other edited volumes. Materials relating to the publication of
		  these volumes are arranged in a distinct subseries of writing by Ormsby. Such
		  materials include: bibliographical and biographical research materials,
		  permissions, contents lists and indexes, drafts of introductions, and copies of
		  primary documents. Correspondence with contributors, editors, or publishers is
		  kept separately in the subseries for personal literary correspondence.
		  Similarly, reviews and other printed matter relating to these texts are found
		  in the subseries for printed material about Ormsby.</p>
            <p>His editorial work on these volumes as well as with
		<title>The Honest Ulsterman</title> has ensured a wide and varied
        correspondence with many important writers in Ireland and Great Britain. Though
        Ormsby's personal literary correspondence and his editorial correspondence
		relating to
		<title>The Honest Ulsterman</title> are located in two distinct series,
		individual letters frequently mention both the poet's own work and
		<title>The Honest Ulsterman</title>. Information related to the poet and
		to the magazine may be found throughout the collection. In this collection's
		several correspondence subseries, writers of interest include
        <persname authfilenumber="85621766" source="viaf" role="schema:knows arch:correspondedWith">Ciaran Carson</persname>,
        <persname authfilenumber="24613408" source="viaf" role="schema:knows arch:correspondedWith">Peter Fallon</persname>,

        <persname authfilenumber="109956735" source="viaf" role="schema:knows arch:correspondedWith">Edna</persname> and
        <persname authfilenumber="39398205" source="viaf" role="schema:knows arch:correspondedWith">Michael Longley</persname>,
        <persname authfilenumber="110228045" source="viaf" role="schema:knows arch:correspondedWith">Derek Mahon</persname>,

		and <persname authfilenumber="92591927" source="viaf" role="schema:knows arch:correspondedWith">James Simmons</persname>, among many others.</p>
            <p>Because of the magazine's importance, both for Ormsby and Northern
		  Irish literary culture,
		<title>The Honest Ulsterman</title> materials constitute a separate and
		sizeable series, which includes correspondence, author files, manuscript
		submissions, publications, and printed material regarding
		<title>The Honest Ulsterman</title>. Manuscript and typescript drafts of
        poetry and prose sent to Ormsby are divided according to those submitted for
		magazine publication and those shared with the poet on a more personal basis.
		Because friends sent material both for personal reasons and for publication,
		the series of writings by others is relatively small compared to
		<title>The Honest Ulsterman</title> author files and magazine submissions
		subseries. Anything sent with an eye towards publication has been kept in
		<title>The Honest Ulsterman</title> series. Similarly, printed material
		regarding the magazine is arranged separately from other printed material
		relating to Ormsby and his work as poet and anthologist.</p>

                    <p>The correspondence series is comprised of two subseries, one for
				personal literary correspondence and the other for project and business
				correspondence. Personal literary correspondence refers to letters for the most
				part sent to Ormsby regarding his own literary career as a poet or educator.
				The project and business correspondence subseries contains communications of a
				contractual and/or editorial nature sent to Ormsby by the editors or publishing
				houses that produced his volumes of poetry and other books.</p>
                    <p>One of the curious features of the correspondence in the Frank
            Ormsby papers is that it is both personal and editorial. Often in the same
				letter, a correspondent will address Ormsby as editor of
            <title>The Honest Ulsterman</title> and then comment on <persname authfilenumber="49280158" source="viaf">Ormsby's</persname> own
            poetry or editorial projects. Even as correspondence related to <persname authfilenumber="49280158" source="viaf">Ormsby's</persname>
			 careers as poet and magazine editor is often interrelated, an effort has been
			 made to distinguish and arrange separately letters pertaining to each of these
			 roles. Correspondence relating to
			 <title>The Honest Ulsterman</title> will be found in two places in
			 Series 2. Some letters are located in author files and others are in a
			 correspondence subseries. Notable writers in this series include: <persname authfilenumber="24613408" source="viaf">Peter Fallon</persname>,

                        <p>This subseries contains <persname authfilenumber="49280158" source="viaf">Ormsby's</persname> correspondence of an editorial
				  and/or business nature. The subseries is divided into two subsections. The
				  project correspondence subsection attempts to maintain the integrity of
              <persname authfilenumber="49280158" source="viaf">Ormsby's</persname> own files arranged according to specific book projects that he edited.
				  Most of the correspondence in these folders pertains to project research,
				  permissions, and contributors' correspondence. Specific contractual or
				  financial correspondence related to the various book projects is included with
				  the correspondence organized according to publisher.</p>
                        <p>The business correspondence subsection is arranged according to
				  specific publishing houses. Individual items are then arranged chronologically.
				  In some cases, as in the <corpname authfilenumber="147893360" source="viaf">Gallery Press</corpname> or <corpname authfilenumber="140705396" source="viaf">Oxford University Press</corpname>
				  correspondence, extensive editorial exchanges between the publisher and Ormsby
				  (as poet) are segregated from the contractual and fiduciary correspondence. In
				  other instances, as in the <corpname authfilenumber="130247428" source="viaf">Blackstaff Press</corpname> correspondence, contractual and
				  editorial correspondence is thoroughly mixed together. In many cases, editors
				  simultaneously refer to or attach together both editorial comments and
				  contractual materials related to the books Ormsby edited. </p>

                    <p>The volume and significance of the Ormsby collection's papers
				related to
			 <title>The Honest Ulsterman</title> necessitate the organization of
			 this material in a distinct series. This series contains documents pertaining
			 to all aspects of the magazine's production.</p>
                    <p>As mentioned, the correspondence received by Ormsby from readers
				and contributors to
            <title>The Honest Ulsterman</title> is distinguished from <persname authfilenumber="49280158" source="viaf">Ormsby's</persname>
			 other personal literary and business correspondence. It is important to note
			 that many of the letters referring to
			 <title>The Honest Ulsterman</title> in the present series also
            mention <persname authfilenumber="49280158" source="viaf">Ormsby's</persname> personal or individual poetic life. An effort has been made to
			 distinguish between letters that focus principally on the personal or poetic
			 life and those chiefly addressed to <persname authfilenumber="49280158" source="viaf">Ormsby's</persname> role as a magazine editor. But, if
			 researching
			 <title>The Honest Ulsterman</title>, it is advisable to examine all
            the correspondence in the Ormsby collection. Note also that additional
			 correspondence from specific individuals is contained in the author files
			 subseries. All correspondence in either the author files or
			 <title>The Honest Ulsterman</title> correspondence subseries is
            arranged chronologically. The restricted <persname authfilenumber="109557338" source="viaf">Seamus Heaney</persname> correspondence
			 (1971-1996) is kept with personal literary correspondence (Subseries 1.1)
			 because individual letters make mention not only of
            <title>Honest Ulsterman</title> submissions but <persname authfilenumber="49280158" source="viaf">Ormsby's</persname> other
			 editorial and poetic projects.</p>
                    <p>The author files reflect <persname authfilenumber="49280158" source="viaf">Ormsby's</persname> own organizational system in
				which the editor maintained specific files of selected contributors to
			 <title>The Honest Ulsterman</title>. In addition to correspondence,
			 these files include an individual author's publication submissions of poetry
			 and prose, as well as promotional and other printed material by and about the
			 writer in question.</p>
                    <p>Another subseries includes work submitted to
			 <title>The Honest Ulsterman</title> by authors not included in
            <persname authfilenumber="49280158" source="viaf">Ormsby's</persname> original author files. Unlike individual works that are catalogued by
			 title in the author files, these poetry and prose submissions are collected by
			 author. The titles of these submissions are not discretely listed. Two other
			 subseries include materials related to the actual publication of specific
			 volumes of
			 <title>The Honest Ulsterman</title> and assorted printed material
			 about the magazine.</p>

                        <p>As editor of
              <title>The Honest Ulsterman</title>, Frank Ormsby kept detailed
				files on a host of individual authors. These files contain correspondence,
				often of both a personal and professional nature, sent to Ormsby or to the
				magazine. Also, many individual writers' manuscript or typescript submissions
				to the magazine have been preserved here. The author files include not just
				individual poems or prose pieces but larger sequences, collections, or
				pamphlets to be reviewed by the editor. Additional materials include
				interviews, worksheets from sessions of the <corpname authfilenumber="123393054" source="viaf">Belfast Group</corpname>, assorted promotional
				materials, and published reviews or essays about particular authors.
				Significantly, though these files originally served as the editor's record of

                    <p>The series for writings by Ormsby includes manuscript and
				typescript drafts as well as galley proofs of writing in poetry or prose. The
				series also contains the scripts used in the broadcasts of various radio-plays,
				readings, and lectures. Additionally, all materials related to books Ormsby
				edited are located here. This series shows the development of individual works
				or volumes up to the point of publication. Published items are then arranged in
				the printed material series.</p>
                    <p>The poetry subseries (3.1) contains notes, manuscript, and
				typescript drafts of published and unpublished poems from 1970 to 1995. The
				published works are arranged chronologically according to major volume. Under
				each volume's heading, the poems are listed alphabetically. These folders
				include manuscript (MS) and/or typescript (TS) versions of the poems. Note that
				brackets often include other relevant information regarding variant titles,
				dates of creation, or relationships to other works. Many works are
				cross-referenced with others. Drafts of different poems are included in the
				same folder when there is no way of separating the poems. In this case, a
				poem's title might be listed without a box or folder number. A note in brackets
				will then refer the reader to the relevant folder where the document in
				question can be found. Typescripts and proofs of entire volumes are included at
				the end of each volume's subsection to roughly demonstrate the chronological
				development of a published volume.</p>

                        <persname authfilenumber="49280158" source="viaf">Ormsby's</persname> prose is collected in a distinct subseries (3.2) where
				works are then arranged by type. There are subsections for fiction,
				autobiographical prose, reviews, essays, speeches, and interviews. Notes after
				individual items indicate where and when the work was published if that
				information is available. Thus, many works are cross-referenced with the
				subseries for <persname authfilenumber="49280158" source="viaf">Ormsby's</persname> printed or published material. Because of the number of
				scripts and because Ormsby has been involved with broadcast presentations from
				1970 to 1989, these are gathered in a separate subseries (3.3).</p>
                    <p>Materials in the subseries (3.4) pertaining to the anthologies
            edited by Ormsby are arranged chronologically, like the poetry, by individual
				book. All items relating to the production of a specific text are presented in
				an order that gestures to the stages in the book's production. This subseries
				contains varied materials including research notes or lists of works under
				consideration for inclusion, actual manuscript or typescript submissions,
				photocopied published texts, as well as <persname authfilenumber="49280158" source="viaf">Ormsby's</persname> drafts of tables of contents,
				forewords, introductions, and indexes.</p>

                        <p>This subseries showcases <persname authfilenumber="49280158" source="viaf">Frank Ormsby's</persname> long and varied career
				  as a poet. Notebooks from the early 1970's contain drafts of many of his
				  earliest published poems as well as very interesting prose synopses or
				  descriptions of other poems. Published poems are arranged chronologically by
				  volume; poems in individual volumes are listed alphabetically. A separate
				  subsection includes typescripts of volumes that were proposed for publication
				  but ultimately went unpublished. A large number of unpublished poems are
				  presented alphabetically. Many of these poems are dated by Ormsby. In some
				  cases, notes indicate that particular texts are linked to others that are more
				  readily dated. There are also a large number of untitled manuscript and
				  typescript fragments roughly arranged chronologically by several-year
				  periods.</p>

                    <p>Published works by <persname authfilenumber="49280158" source="viaf">Ormsby</persname> are collected under one subseries

            arranged alphabetically. Printed material about <persname authfilenumber="49280158" source="viaf">Ormsby</persname> is gathered in a
				distinct subseries that is further divided into four subsections: one for
				articles, essays, or other biographical documents about <persname authfilenumber="49280158" source="viaf">Ormsby</persname> as a literary or
            public figure; one for reviews and clippings about <persname authfilenumber="49280158" source="viaf">Ormsby's</persname> books of poetry;
				another for reviews and clippings about the books that he has edited; and a
				fourth for promotional material for his work, including documents relating to
				readings and lectures.</p>
                    <p>Other printed material kept by <persname authfilenumber="49280158" source="viaf">Ormsby</persname> is collected in a third
				subseries that is also divided into various groups of related materials. This
				subseries collects a large number of poems, articles, reviews, essays, and
				stories written by many well-known writers and critics. Apart from the
				cut-outs, <persname authfilenumber="49280158" source="viaf">Ormsby</persname> also kept various magazines and newspapers in their entirety.
				An avid theater-goer, <persname authfilenumber="49280158" source="viaf">Ormsby</persname> preserved the playbills of numerous plays
            performed in <geogname authfilenumber="7001306" source="tgn">Dublin</geogname> and <geogname authfilenumber="7019168" source="tgn">Belfast</geogname> theaters from the early 1970's until the
				1990's. Most of these programs, however, are from the 1970's. They are largely
				arranged by theater. Event programs and catalogues from artistic or literary
				occasions are arranged in yet another subsection.</p>

				the late twentieth-century. Many of the photographs are head shots of high
				quality and were originally intended for promotional use by either the writer
				or the publishing house representing the writer. There are two subsections of
				photographs. One contains photos of <persname authfilenumber="49280158" source="viaf">Ormsby</persname>, and many of these are snapshots
				from readings or other literary events. The other subsection contains
				photographs of other literary figures. Folders dedicated to photographs of
				individual writers are arranged alphabetically by author. A photograph of a
				particular group of writers is organized separately.</p>
