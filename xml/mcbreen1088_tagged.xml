          <p>The poems subseries (Subseries 2.2) includes manuscript and
            typescript drafts of McBreen's collected and uncollected poetry. The
            collected poetry (subseries 2.2a) is arranged in chronological order
            by book and contains multiple copies of the same poems, providing
            insight into McBreen's meticulous process of writing and
            rewriting/revising her poetry in order to craft a final version. The
            subseries also contains a considerable number of McBreen's
            uncollected poems (2.2b), featuring both manuscripts and typescripts
            that are arranged here in alphabetical order. </p>
          <p>McBreen's edited works (Subseries 2.3) consists of her editorial
            work on the poetry anthology, <title>The White Page</title>. This
            comprehensive study of contemporary Irish female poets features
            brief biographies and single poems by prominent poets, which are
            found in manuscript and typescript form in the individual author
            folders in the subseries. In addition, the author folders contain
            correspondence to and from McBreen, editorial corrections, and
            clippings. This subseries also contains general correspondence
            concerning the writing and publication of <title>The White
              Page</title> and a typescript draft of McBreen's editorial
            introduction to the anthology. Lastly, this subseries contains poem
            corrections, proof copies, contributor lists, and literary contact
            information for the 1999 publication. </p>
          <p>The final subseries (2.4), titled "Other Writings" is primarily
            comprised of McBreen's dissertation work, which later became the
            foundational research for her anthology, <title>The White
              Page</title>. In addition, the subseries also includes McBreen's
            Irish to English translations of a small number of poems, an
            interview typescript, a book review, an essay submission, a letter
            to the editor, and a formal introduction of fellow Irish female
            poets. </p>

            <p>The notebook subseries, spanning from the late 1980s to late
              1990s, contains manuscript drafts of some of McBreen's collected
              and uncollected poems, literary notes and quotations, dated
              records of literary correspondence, and personal reminders.
              Although many of the notebooks have few writings, some allow
              insight into McBreen's creative writing process and her
              personal/academic literary interests. </p>

            <p>The subseries includes manuscript and typescript drafts of
              McBreen's collected and uncollected poetry from 1986-1999. Of note
              to researchers is the thematic unity that runs throughout the
              entirety of the poetry subseries, centering on feelings of loss
              and renewal, familial memories and celebrations, local phenomena
              and politics, and the particularities of the Irish landscape. The
              collected poetry is arranged in chronological order by work,
              including McBreen's <title>The Wind Beyond the Wall</title>
              (1990), <title>A Walled Garden in Moylough</title> (1995), and
                <title>Winter in the Eye: New and Selected Poems</title> (2003).
              Many of the poems in this subseries have multiple drafts,
              providing researchers' insight into McBreen's meticulous process
              of writing and rewriting/revising her poetry in order to craft a
              final version. </p>
            <p>This subseries also contains a considerable number of McBreen's
              uncollected poems, which were composed in large part during the
              seven year gap (1996-2002) between the publication of the poet's
                <title>A Walled Garden in Moylough</title> and <title>Winter in
                the Eye.</title> Some uncollected poems, however, were composed
              in the late 1980s and early 1990. Although McBreen offers no
              explicit rationale for how poems were selected for various
              collections, it remains clear that the poet subjected her
              uncollected poetry to equally rigorous revision processes, as many
              folders in this subseries contain uncollected poems that were
              written and revised multiple times. The uncollected poems are
              written in both manuscript and typescript forms, and are arranged
              here in alphabetical order.</p>

            <p>The series consists of McBreen's editorial work on the poetry
              anthology, <title>The White Page: Twentieth-Century Irish Women
                Poets </title>(1999). This comprehensive study of contemporary
              Irish female poets features brief biographies and single poems by
              prominent poets, which are found in manuscript and typescript form
              in the individual author folders in the subseries. In addition,
              the author folders, which are arranged in alphabetical order,
              contain correspondence between McBreen and the authors,
              demonstrating a vibrant and mutually supportive literary network
              of Irish female poets. The subseries also includes editorial
              corrections, clippings about various poets, proof copies of the
              anthology, contributor lists, literary contact information, and
              general correspondence concerning the writing and publication of
                <title>The White Page</title>. Importantly, the subseries also
              holds a typescript draft of McBreen's editorial introduction to
              the anthology, an essay that first originated while the poet wrote
              her master's dissertation on Irish female poets. Photographs of
                <title>The White Page</title> contributors including publicity
              photos, portraits, and personal snapshots donated to McBreen may
              be found in Series 6: Photographs.</p>

              dissertation work, which later became the foundational research
              for her anthology, <title>The White Page</title>. In addition, the
              subseries also includes McBreen's Irish to English translations of

              an essay submission, a doctoral dissertation proposal, and a
              formal introduction of fellow Irish female poets. This series, in
              addition to the poet's editorial role in the publication of
                <title>The White Page</title>, demonstrates McBreen's active

          <p>This series is comprised of printed material by Joan McBreen, about Joan McBreen, and general printed items from 1985-2007. Although poems published between 1987 and 1999 make up the largest part of the printed material by McBreen, she did publish one letter to the editor of an unidentified newspaper concerning the value of modern poetry. In contrast to the narrow focus of the printed material by McBreen, the printed material about McBreen consists of a variety of published resources pertaining to the author, including articles, programs, announcements, promotional material, and reviews of many of her published poetry collections. Lastly, the general printed material, spanning from 1978-2007, is comprised of magazine articles, brochures, flyers, newsletters, newspaper clippings, poetry inserts, programs, travel materials, and numerous periodicals. Of note to researchers is McBreen's extensive collection of articles and clippings, which demonstrate an acute concern with the <?oxy_delete author="namedropper" timestamp="20130621T153942-0400" content="success"?><?oxy_insert_start author="namedropper" timestamp="20130621T153942-0400" comment="Howard Bailey, Jr. (born March 9, 1980), better known by his stage name Chingy, is an American rapper.

He was one of the foremost members of the Acmeist school of poets. He was arrested by Joseph Stalin's government during the repression of the 1930s and sent into internal exile with his wife Nadezhda. Given a reprieve of sorts, they moved to Voronezh in southwestern Russia."?><persname source="viaf" authfilenumber="102337271">Osip Mandelstam</persname><?oxy_insert_end ?>," and "This Light, This Silence," <title>Maryland Poetry Review</title>,
