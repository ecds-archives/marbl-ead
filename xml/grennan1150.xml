      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Eamon Grennan, Irish poet and professor, was born on November 13, 1941 in Dublin, Ireland, to Thomas P. and Evelyn Grennan.  Grennan received a B.A. and M.A. in English from University College, Dublin, in 1963 and 1964 respectively.  He lived in Rome from 1965-1966, then moved to the United States for graduate school.  He received his Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1973.  He married Joan Perkins, whom he met in Rome, in 1972.  The couple had two children, Kate Grennan and Conor Grennan.  They divorced in 1985.  He subsequently met long time companion, classicist Rachel Kitzinger, with whom he has one daughter, Kira Grennan.</p>
      <p>Grennan taught at Herbert Lehman College, City University of New York, from 1971-1974.  In 1974, he accepted a position with Vassar College, where he taught English until his retirement in 2004.  During a year's leave from Vassar in 1977, which he spent in Ireland, he began writing poetry seriously for the first time.  Grennan published his first volume of poetry, <title>Wildly for Days</title>, in 1983.  He has published numerous volumes of poetry since, including <title>What Light There Is</title> (1987), <title>As If It Matters</title> (1991), <title>So It Goes</title> (1995), <title>Relations: New &amp; Selected Poems</title> (1998), <title>Selected &amp; New Poems</title> (2000), <title>The Quick of It</title> (2005), <title>Out of Breath</title> (2007), <title>Matter of Fact</title> (2008), and <title>Out of Sight:  New and Selected Poems</title> (2010).  His <title>What Light There Is and Other Poems</title> (1989) was a finalist for a <title>Los Angeles Times</title> Book Prize, and <title>Still Life with Waterfall</title> (2002) won the Lenore Marshall Poetry Prize in 2003.</p>
        <p>Grennan has also edited several volumes including <title>New Irish Writing: Essays in Memory of Raymond J. Porter</title> (1989), and <title>Facing the Music: Irish Poetry in the Twentieth Century</title> (2004).  He has also translated numerous works by Italian poet Giacomo Leopardi, as well as an edition of <title>Oedipus at Colonus</title> (2004) on which he partnered with Kitzinger.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
      <p>The collection consists of the personal and literary papers of Eamon Grennan from 1943-2010.  The papers include a small amount of correspondence and personal papers; writings by Grennan; writings by others; diaries; printed material; and photographs.  Correspondence is limited, but includes editorial correspondence, letters from colleagues and other writers including Peter Fallon and Ann Roesnes, and personal correspondence from friends and family.  Personal papers include biographical information about Grennan such as his curriculum vitae and bibliography, as well as appointment books and contracts.</p>
      <p>Writings by Grennan form the bulk of the collection and include both Grennan's poetry and prose works, as well as notebooks, lectures, and teaching files.  Writings by others consist of literary manuscripts sent to or collected by Grennan from other authors such as Louis Asekoff, Tom MacIntyre, and Desmond O'Grady.  Also present are manuscripts of Grennan's translations of other authors' works.  The diaries are personal in nature and chronicle Grennan's life and travels.  Printed material contains copies of Grennan's published writings, promotional materials relating to his appearances and speaking engagements, and general printed material relating to other authors or topics of interest to Grennan.  There are very few photographs in the collection and primarily consist of unidentified people and places.</p>

          <p>The series consists of writings by Eamon Grennan from 1962-2010, including poetry, prose, notebooks, and lecture and teaching files.  The poetry series contains collected works, as well as uncollected, some of which were published in journals and magazines.  Over the years, Grennan also maintained files containing drafts of his poems which he arranged in chronological order.  This original arrangement has been preserved, though items may duplicate drafts found elsewhere in the subseries.</p>
          <p>The series also contains Grennan's prose writings such as essays, articles, reviews, short stories, and papers written while he was a graduate student at Harvard.  Also present in the series are notebooks that contain both poetry and prose, drafts of invited lectures, material relating to poetry readings given by Grennan, and files from courses that he taught.  Lecture files include drafts as well as reference material.  Teaching files may contain syllabi, notes and assignments.</p>

The collected poetry subseries (Subseries 2.2a) includes drafts of individual poems, draft typescripts of whole works, proofs, front matter, some editorial correspondence, and other materials relating to the publication process.  The uncollected poetry and translations subseries (Subseries 2.1b) contains uncollected poems, some of which were individually published in journals and magazines.  It also includes several French translations of Grennan's poetry by Michèle Duclos.  The chronological poetry drafts subseries (Subseries 2.1c) consists of drafts of poems arranged chronologically by Grennan.  Poems in this subseries may duplicate poems found in the subseries for both collected and uncollected poetry.</p>

              <p>The subseries contains poetry from published and unpublished collected works, as well as materials pertaining to the publication process.  The collected poetry is arranged in chronological order by publication date and includes drafts of individual poems, as well as drafts of whole typescripts, proofs, front matter, and some editorial correspondence.  Grennan frequently changed the title of a collection during the process of compiling and revising the typescript.  Typescripts with these variant titles have been arranged in alphabetical order within each work, with different drafts in chronological order to the extent that could be determined.</p>
              <p>Most collected works also include working files that contain poems considered for publication in that work but which ultimately were not included.  Some also include working files titled "Towards [work]," as labeled by Grennan.  The original arrangement of these folders has been retained to preserve evidence of early drafting efforts.  Many poems in the subseries have multiple drafts which may be located with typescripts of a complete work, working files, and the folder for that individual poem.  Not all collected works contain all of these materials.</p>
              <p>The series also contains typescript drafts of other collected works, including unpublished works and small collections of poems published together in journals.  Most of the unpublished works are from the 1970s, and were compiled by Grennan for personal reasons, such as to commemorate his wife's birthday.</p>

              <p>The subseries contains uncollected poems by Grennan.  Some of these poems were published in journals and magazines.  Most poems have multiple drafts with revisions, which are arranged in the same folder.  The majority of the drafts are undated, so internal organization does not reflect draft order in most cases.  Duplicate folder titles in the container list reflect Grennan's reuse of the same titles for different poems.</p>

              <p>The subseries contains drafts of poems arranged chronologically by Grennan from 1962-2008.  Grennan's original arrangement has been preserved, with the exception that poems have been arranged alphabetically within each folder.  The dates on folders often overlap, such that a poem might appear in multiple folders within a given date range.  This subseries, while not a comprehensive collection of all of Grennan's poems, reveals the scope of his work throughout his career.</p>
              <p>The poems in this subseries might also duplicate poems located in Subseries 2.1a:  Collected poetry and Subseries 2.1b:  Uncollected poetry.</p>

It includes a few academic notebooks about the Renaissance that Grennan wrote while he was a student at Harvard in the late 1960s.

            <p>The series consists of files relating to lectures and poetry readings given by Eamon Grennan, and classes and workshops taught by Grennan.  Lecture files include notes and drafts, as well as supplementary material relating to the topic.  These files document invited lectures given outside a classroom setting.  Poetry reading files include information about the event, as well as the poems Grennan read.  Teaching files may include syllabi, notes for lectures, reading assignments and research material.  Some courses have been identified, however most files could not be tied to a single course offering and are instead arranged independently by subject.</p>
