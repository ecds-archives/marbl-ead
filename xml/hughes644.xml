      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Ted Hughes was born on <date normal="1930-08-17" type="schema:birthDate">August 17th, 1930</date>, the third child of <persname source="viaf" authfilenumber="11604654" role="schema:parent">Edith Farrar</persname> and William
        Hughes of <geogname source="geonames" authfilenumber="2641922" role="schema:birthPlace">Mytholmroyd, Yorkshire</geogname>. When he was seven the family moved to <geogname source="geonames" authfilenumber="2642683" role="schema:homeLocation">Mexborough</geogname>, a nearby
        mining town, where Hughes' parents ran a local newsagent's shop. There Hughes attended
        Mexborough Grammar School where he first began writing adventure stories and, later, verse,
        as he has explained, "when I discovered that what I wrote amused my classmates." Two poems
        from this period-among the earliest he wrote-survive in the Ted Hughes papers.</p>
      <p>In 1948 Hughes won a scholarship to attend <corpname source="viaf" authfilenumber="167939795" role="schema:alumniOf">Pembroke College, Cambridge</corpname>, but he first
        completed two years of national service as a ground wireless mechanic in an isolated RAF
        station in <geogname source="geonames" authfilenumber="2650345" role="schema:workLocation">East Yorkshire</geogname>. As he later recalled, there he had "nothing to do but read and
        reread Shakespeare and watch the grass grow." The landscape of his early years in Yorkshire
        left a permanent imprint on his later poetry as it also did on his life-long habits of
        sight.</p>
      <p>In 1951 Hughes entered Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he first studied English
        literature, before switching in his third year to archaeology and anthropology. After
        completing his degree, Hughes divided his time between Cambridge and <geogname source="geonames" authfilenumber="2643743" role="schema:homeLocation">London</geogname> where he drifted
        between a variety of odd jobs, among them that of a script reader for <corpname source="dbpedia" authfilenumber="Pinewood_Studios" role="schema:worksFor">Pinewood Studios</corpname> (?).
        In the years immediately after finishing at Cambridge, he also began publishing poems under
        a variety of pseudonyms in local literary magazines, among them <title>Chequer</title>,
        <corpname source="dbpedia" authfilenumber="Granta" role="schema:worksFor"><emph render="italic">Granta</emph></corpname>, and <corpname source="dbpedia" authfilenumber="Delta_(magazine)" role="schema:worksFor"><emph render="italic">Delta</emph></corpname>.</p>
      <p>In February 1956 Hughes contributed four poems to a new literary magazine called <corpname source="dbpedia" authfilenumber="St._Botolph%27s_Review" role="schema:worksFor"><emph render="italic">St. Boltoph's Review</emph></corpname>. It was at a party to mark the launch of the new magazine that he
        first met the American poet <persname source="viaf" authfilenumber="14775269" role="schema:spouse">Sylvia Plath</persname> who was in Cambridge on a Fulbright Scholarship.
        Soon after, on Bloomsday, June 16th, 1956, they were married in a small service at the
        church of St. George the Martyr in London.</p>
      <p>At the time, Plath had already published numerous stories and poems in leading American
        magazines, and she soon introduced Hughes to an active program or regular manuscript
        submissions to leading literary magazines far beyond Cambridge. His first acceptance, as
        recorded in the scrapbook that Plath kept at the time, came with the publication of "Bawdry
        Embraced" in the August 1956 issue of <corpname source="dbpedia" authfilenumber="Poetry_magazine" role="schema:worksFor"><emph render="italic">Poetry</emph></corpname> magazine.</p>
      <p>On the first anniversary of their meeting, Hughes learned that a collection of his poems,
          <title>The Hawk in the Rain</title>, had been selected by Marianne Moore, W.H. Auden, and
        Stephen Spender, as the best first collection out of 287 entries in a poetry competition
        organized by the Young Men's and Young Women's Hebrew Association of New York. With the
        publication of <title>The Hawk in the Rain</title> in both London and New York, Ted Hughes'
        literary career was launched. </p>
      <p>From 1957 to 1959, Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath lived in the <geogname source="geonames" authfilenumber="6252001" role="schema:homeLocation">United States</geogname> where Plath
        taught at Smith College and Hughes at the <corpname source="dbpedia" authfilenumber="University_of_Massachusetts" role="schema:worksFor">University of Massachusetts</corpname>. It was while living
        in the U.S. that Hughes met the artist <persname source="viaf" authfilenumber="79049216" role="schema:knows">Leonard Baskin</persname> who first suggested a sequence of
        poems based on a mythical crow figure and who later became a frequent collaborator on a
        number of fine press, artist's editions of Hughes' work. After a camping trip across the
        U.S. in the summer of 1959, Ted and Sylvia spent several weeks in residence at the <corpname source="dbpedia" authfilenumber="Yaddo" role="schema:workLocation">Yaddo</corpname>
        artists' colony in upstate New York. There Hughes worked on the poems that would later be
        collected in his second collection, <title>Lupercal</title>.</p>
      <p>They returned to England in December and the following Spring Hughes learned that he had
        won both the Somerset Maugham Award and the Hawthorndon Prize (the latter for his second
        collection, <title>Lupercal</title>). A short time later their first child, <persname source="viaf" authfilenumber="46896227" role="schema:children">Frieda</persname>, was
        born. Partly to support his new family, Hughes began a series of radio talks for the <corpname source="viaf" authfilenumber="127458402" role="schema:worksFor">BBC</corpname>'s
        Listening and Writing program (later collected in <title>Poetry in the Making</title>), and
        in August the Hughes' moved into "Court Green," a former rectory in the village of <geogname source="geonames" authfilenumber="2641245" role="schema:homeLocation">North
        Tawton</geogname> in Devon. In January 1962 their second child, <persname source="viaf" authfilenumber="78733107" role="schema:children">Nicholas </persname>, was born.</p>
      <p>During the fall of 1962 Hughes began seeing the artist <persname source="viaf" authfilenumber="51807905" role="schema:knows">Assia Wevill</persname> and soon after he and
        Sylvia Plath separated. While suffering from depression the following winter, Plath took her
        own life.</p>
      <p>After Sylvia Plath's suicide, Hughes published a series of children's books, <title>How the
          Whale Became</title> (1963), <title>The Earth-Owl and Other Moon People</title> (1963),
          <title>Nessie the Mannerless Monster</title> (1964), and in 1965 he began serving as a
        judge for the National Children's Poetry Competition. He also, along with <persname source="viaf" authfilenumber="68911711" role="schema:colleague">Daniel Weissbort</persname>,
        founded the journal <corpname source="dbpedia" authfilenumber="Modern_Poetry_in_Translation" role="schema:founderOf"><emph render="italic">Modern Poetry in Translation</emph></corpname> devoted to introducing the
        work of foreign language poets to English readers. Also in 1965, Hughes published
          <title>Ariel</title>, the posthumous collection of Sylvia Plath's poems upon which her
        reputation as a poet largely rests. In January 1967 Hughes and Assia Wevill's daughter Shura
        was born.</p>
      <p>In 1967 Hughes published <title>Wodwo</title>, a collection of new poems, short stories,
        and a single radio play that he had previously recorded for the BBC. He also worked on a
        variety of other projects including serving as co-director of Poetry International, a major
        literary festival that included leading poets from around the world. He also collaborated
        with the director <persname source="viaf" authfilenumber="54145090" role="schema:colleague">Peter Brook</persname> on a stage adaptation of Seneca's <title>Oedipus</title> for
        the <corpname source="dbpedia" authfilenumber="National_Theatre_Company" role="schema:worksFor">National Theatre Company</corpname> and translated a selection of poems by Yehuda Amichai
        (published in 1968). </p>
      <p>In March 1969 Hughes' partner, Assia Wevill took her own life and that of Shura. Later that
        same year Hughes' mother also passed away.</p>
      <p>In the late-1960s Hughes divided his time between <geogname source="geonames" authfilenumber="2963597" role="schema:homeLocation">Ireland</geogname> and England and considered for a
        time moving permanently to Ireland; however, in 1969 he purchased Lumb Bank in his native
        Yorkshire. The following year he returned to Devon where he married <persname source="viaf" authfilenumber="93262345" role="schema:spouse">Carol Orchard</persname> and where
        he settled permanently.</p>
      <p>Beginning in 1970, and continuing over the next few years, Hughes published the cycle of
        crow poems that he had first begun at the suggestion of Leonard Baskin. In 1971 he also saw
        into print three collections of poems by Sylvia Plath, <title>Crossing the Water</title>,
          <title>Lyonnesse</title>, and <title>Winter Trees</title>. That same year he traveled to
        <geogname source="geonames" authfilenumber="130758" role="schema:workLocation">Iran</geogname> where he again collaborated with Peter Brook, this time on a performance of
          <title>Orghast</title> which was first performed on the ruins of Persepolis. </p>
      <p>In 1972 Ted and Carol Hughes purchased Moortown Farm in Devon which they managed with
        Carol's father, Jack Orchard. That same year, <corpname source="dbpedia" authfilenumber="Faber_and_Faber" role="schema:worksFor">Faber and Faber</corpname> issued a selection of Hughes'
        poems and an expanded edition of <title>Crow</title>. In 1974 Hughes received the
        prestigious Queen's Medal for Poetry. After the publication of his long poem
          <title>Gaudete</title> in 1977, Hughes published a series of collections that reflected
        his roots in the natural worlds of Yorkshire and Devon. These included <title>Remains of
          Elmet</title> (1979), <title>Moortown Elegies</title> (1979), and <title>Moortown</title>
        (1979), the latter dedicated to his father-in-law, Jack Orchard.</p>
      <p>Hughes' interests in rural life and in children's education were combined in his work on
        behalf of the <corpname source="dbpedia" authfilenumber="Farms_for_City_Children" role="schema:member">Farms for City Children</corpname> program in the late 1970s. During this period and
        throughout the 1980s he continued to publish numerous works for children, and in 1982 he and
        Seamus Heaney collaborated on <title>The Rattle Bag</title>, an anthology of poems for
        children. In 1984 Ted Hughes was named Poet Laureate to the Queen, succeeding Sir John
        Betjeman. A collection of his laureate poems were collected in 1994 under the title
          <title>Rain-Charm for the Duchy</title>. Hughes' life-long interest--and love
        for--Shakespeare culminated in the 1992 study of his plays, <title>Shakespeare and the
          Goddess of Complete Being</title>.</p>
      <p>After contributing to a collection of translations of Ovid in 1994, Hughes embarked on a
        series of translations of the <title>Metamorphoses</title>, which were published as
          <title>Tales from Ovid</title> in 1997. In February 1998 Hughes surprised the literary
        world with the publication of <title>Birthday Letters</title>, a series of 88 poems written
        to his first wife, Sylvia Plath. The critic Al Alvarez described them as "the most
        vulnerable he ever wrote, and also the saddest." Hughes' annus mirabilis continued with the
        completion of translations, in rapid succession, of three major dramatic works Racine's
          <title>Phedre</title>, Aeschylus' <title>The Oresteia</title>, and Euripides'
          <title>Alcestis</title>. </p>
      <p>On <date normal="1998-10-28">October 28th, 1998</date> Ted Hughes died of cancer. In May 1999, the world paid tribute in a
        memorial service at London's Westminster Abbey.</p>

          <p>The Ted Hughes papers contain extensive files of correspondence dating from 1959-1997.
            The largest part of this correspondence is located in Series 1, though letters related
            to specific projects or activities may also be found in the subject files located in
            Series 5. Over the years, Hughes maintained different systems of filing for these
            letters. For many years he maintained an alphabetical correspondence file which
            contained letters from friends and colleagues with whom he had sustained correspondence.
            This alphabetical arrangement has been preserved in Subseries 1.1. Subseries 1.2,
            Business correspondence, includes correspondence with his publishers <corpname source="dbpedia" authfilenumber="Faber_and_Faber">Faber and Faber</corpname>,
            <corpname source="dbpedia" authfilenumber="Harper_and_row">Harper and Row</corpname>, as well as correspondence related to his work on behalf of the <corpname source="dbpedia" authfilenumber="Arvon_foundation">Arvon
            Foundation</corpname>. Subseries 1.3 contains general correpondence that was not alphabetized by
            Hughes. Letters from individuals for whom there was an existing alphabetical file in
            Subseries 1.1 have been moved to that subseries. Hughes also received a large amount of
            correspondence from children responding to his children's books. These letters may be
            found in Subseries 1.4. Holograph or typescript drafts of letters written by Ted Hughes
            or photocopies of outgoing letters by him are located in Subseries 1.5. Correspondence
            both to and from Ted Hughes acquired from other sources can be found in Series 10. Any
            correspondence that was found on the verso of works was photocopied and added to this
            series, with a note on the bottom of the photocopy as to where the original
            correspondence is located in the collection.</p>

            <p>The subseries contains notebooks of Ted Hughes from ca. 1949-ca. 1990. The notebooks
              include titled and untitled drafts of published and unpublished poems and prose, a few
              diary entries and autobiographical notes from ca. 1968 August [Notebook 9], and

            <p>The subseries consists of poems by Ted Hughes that have been collected in published
              works from 1957-1995. Materials relating to his published collections may include
              drafts of the book's table of contents, manuscript and typescript poems, complete
              typescripts, and proofs. The manuscripts and typescripts of individual poems have been
              arranged alphabetically by the poem's title. If a poem was known by more than one
              title, the variant title(s) have been provided in brackets. If a poem was made up of,
              or included, other poems this is also indicated in brackets, thus [includes . . . .].
              Because of Hughes' propensity to reuse paper, cross-references are used to note
              locations of related materials in other parts of the collection.</p>

            <p>The subseries consists of manuscript and typescript drafts of uncollected poems of
              Ted Hughes. Maintaining Hughes' original order, the subseries also includes a grouping
              of Crow-related poems. If a poem was known by more than one title, the variant
              title(s) have been provided in brackets. If a poem was made up of, or included, other
              poems this is also indicated in brackets, thus [includes ...]. Because of Hughes'
              propensity to reuse paper, cross-references are used to note locations of related
              materials in other parts of the collection.</p>

            <p>This subseries consists of prose written by Hughes, in manuscript (MS), typescript
              (TS) and galley formats. Apart from his few short stories, Hughes wrote a number of
              introductions to other people's works as well as to his own, and many of those
              forewords are represented here. He also spent many years as an occasional book
              reviewer, often for the Listener and New Statesman, producing essays on an eclectic
              selection of texts. Not only does this collection include the manuscripts used in
              preparation of his selected prose, Winter Pollen (1994), but also many older
              manuscripts of uncollected essays. Of particular note in the prose subseries are the
              drafts of his 1991 volume on Shakespeare, Shakespeare and the Goddess of Complete
              Being, in which one can see the development of his ideas on Shakespeare in detail. For
              ease of reference, Keith Sagar's classification numbers have been inserted in brackets
              next to many entries, particularly for sections (3) and (4) (from Ted Hughes: A
              Bibliography, 1946 – 1995 (2nd edition, 1998)). Because of Hughes' propensity to reuse
              paper, cross-references are used to note locations of related materials in other parts
              of the collection.</p>

              <p>The subseries contains manuscript and types drafts of book-length prose by Ted
                Hughes from 1967-1995. A large part of this subseries consists of works relating to
                Hughes's interest in William Shakespeare. The introduction Hughes wrote for <title>A
                  Choice of Shakespeare's Verse</title> was the genesis of his ideas on Shakespeare
                and myth, which eventually came to fruition in <title>Shakespeare and the Goddess of
                  Complete Being</title>, published over twenty years later. Hughes's selection of
                Shakespeare's verse was first published in 1971 in America by Doubleday (as
                  <title>With Fairest Flower While Summer Lasts: Poems from Shakespeare</title>) and
                then six months later by Faber (as <title>A Choice of Shakespeare's Verse</title>)
                in the UK. TH's introduction was the same for both editions, although arranged
                differently. Twenty years later, the selection was republished, first by Faber (as
                  <title>A Choice of Shakespeare's Verse</title>), followed quickly by the Ecco
                Press in America (as <title>The Essential Shakespeare</title>). Hughes revised the
                introductory essay for these 1991 editions, but again, they are the same for the US
                and the UK editions.</p>
              <p>As with much of Ted Hughes's work, <title>Shakespeare and the Goddess of Complete
                  Being</title> (SGCB) went through an exhaustive drafting process. Its beginnings
                were in the introduction he wrote in 1971 for his selection of Shakespeare's verse,
                and indeed TH included in the <title>SGCB</title> archive some initial rewrites of
                his <title>Essential Shakespeare</title> introduction. "[T]his rewrite eventually
                developed – through these manuscripts" (TH's index note, Box 21) into a series of
                letters Hughes wrote to Donya Feuer from 23 April to 14 June 1990. In a note
                attached to the archive, TH writes that "Danya Feuers [sic] works with Ingmar
                Bergman in the Swedish Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm. She is an old friend who
                has done a great deal of work with Shakespeare – a great deal of work, toe [sic], in
                developing my ideas about the plays with Swedish actors." As he notes in the
                "Foreword" to <title>SGCB</title>, "it [occurred] to me that if I anatomized what I
                had identified as Shakespeare's myth, as it revealed itself in each work, and
                followed through what are to me its fascinating evolutions, and set it all out in
                letters to Donya Feuer, bit by bit, as simply as possible, who knows, maybe
                something would emerge. Those letters became this book" (xiii). In the letters to
                Feuer, Hughes has already divided his project into five broad sections. Thereafter
                he begins to divide up these sections into smaller "chapters," as many as 80 of
                them, eventually arranged into six sections (instead of the initial five – see 24
                July 1991 letter to his copy editor, Gillian Bate), and then further arranged into
                three very broad "Parts." In a letter of 30 July 1991, Bate recommended that he
                remove the small numbered chapters and instead refer to the six sections as
                chapters, still under three broad Parts. This is the general final structure of the
                published version. There are seven complete typescript drafts of <title>SGCB</title>
                in the collection. For purposes of differentiation, they are numbered TS 1 – 7
                according to their apparent order of composition.</p>

              <p>The subseries consists of manuscript and typescript drafts of introductions and
                forewords written by Ted Hughes from 1962-1997. Because of Hughes' propensity to
                reuse paper, cross-references are used to note locations of related materials in

              <p>The subseries consists of essays, review and talks by Ted Hughes. Some essays
                written earlier in TH's career but chosen for republication in <title>Winter
                  Pollen</title> , 1994, were organized by TH in a group with the other
                  <title>Winter Pollen</title> essays. We have followed TH's own manuscript
                arrangement in the archive, and many of TH's essays will be found in the
                  <title>Winter Pollen</title> section. The subseries also contains several pieces
                of a biographical nature: "Biographical notes on self" written by Hughes in ca. 1975
                and "Notes on Published Works" containing Hughes comments in 1992 on some of his
                works. Because of Hughes' propensity to reuse paper, cross-references are used to
                note locations of related materials in other parts of the collection.</p>

            <p>The subseries consists materials relating to Hughes's childrens collected works from
              1961-1997. Materials relating to his published collections may include drafts of the
              book's table of contents, manuscript and typescript poems, complete typescripts, and
              proofs. The manuscripts and typescripts of individual poems have been arranged
              alphabetically by the poem's title, with unpublished material at the end of the
              subseries. If a poem was known by more than one title, the variant title(s) have been
              provided in brackets. If a poem was made up of, or included, other poems this is also
              indicated in brackets, thus [includes . . . .]. Because of Hughes' propensity to reuse
              paper, cross-references are used to note locations of related materials in other parts
              of the collection.</p>

          <p>The series consists of subject files relating to variety of topics including Hughes's
            involvement in the Arvon Foundation and other literary societies, Iron Man Productions,
            and environmental groups. The files contain correspondence, printed material, and other
            types of material. This series documents Hughes's strong interest in river conservation
            both nationally and locally in England. The series also includes a transcript of an
            interview of Hughes for the <title>Paris Review</title> (1994), an early list of
            magazine submissions [some in Sylvia Plath's hand], and information regarding several
            reading tours.</p>

          <p>Published material that has been collected by Hughes is represented in this printed
            material series, which contains texts by Hughes, texts about Hughes' work, and texts by
            others about various issues of interest to Hughes. In most cases, descriptions of
            individually listed items note the date and source of publication.</p>
          <p>Published works by Hughes are collected under one subseries arranged chronologically by
            publication date. Printed material about Hughes is gathered in a distinct subseries that
            is further divided into three subsections: articles, clippings, promotional material for
            his work, including documents relating to readings. The third subseries contains reviews
            about Hughes books including poetry, plays, and audio productions.</p>
          <p>The final subseries consists of two s. The first scrapbook contains clippings of Ted
            Hughes' poems and other writings, reviews of his work, and some letters from 1956-1963.
            The second scrapbook contains clippings of Hughes's and Sylvia Plath's poems and other
            writings, reviews of their works, and other press notices from 1963-1968.</p>

          <p>The series consists of audio-visual materials relating to Ted Hughes including
            audiocassettes, videotapes, and a motion picture film. The majority of the
            audiocassettes are of Ted Hughes dictating <title>Shakespeare and the Goddess of
              Complete Being</title> to a typist which includes all capitalization, punctuation,
            etc. Chapter numbers are based on Ted Hughes' dictation; some may be incorrect. Other
            audiocassettes include a 1963 British Broadcasting Corporation interview with Sylvia
            Plath from BBC Sound Archives and "Service of Thanksgiving for the Life and Work of Ted
            Hughes," 13 May 1999. The motion picture film dipicts a Mexborough Grammar School field
            trip to Switzerland in 1949.</p>

          <p>The collected materials located in Series 10 include correspondence and other material
            acquired from various sources. It is primarily composed of letters written by Hughes
            with some accompanying enclosures. This correspondence has been arranged alphabetically
            and chronologically by the last name of the correspondent. The one exception is a set of
            letters regarding the 1967 Poetry International Festival which Ted Hughes helped
            organize. This correspondence, including letters from Yehuda Amichai, W.H. Auden, Allen
            Ginsberg, Pablo Neruda, and others, are grouped alphabetically under Poetry
            International. The series also includes a manuscript of <title>Her Husband: Hughes and
              Plath: A Marriage</title> by Diane Middlebrook and a copybook kept by Enid Wilkinson
            containing two early Ted Hughes poems written in his hand. For details regarding the
            provenance of specific items in this artificially assembled portion of the collection,
            consult the library staff.</p>
